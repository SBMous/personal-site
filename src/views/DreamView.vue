      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>
        Utopia is real, and it is within our hands to build it. Achieving Utopia centres on solving a few core
        behavioural problems. Fortunately, despite their behavioural nature it is likely that we can augment human
        behaviour through the use of technology.

      <h2>Act 1: Ghosts of Christmas Past</h2>
      <p>
        Reflections on how we got where we are, the positives that were and leading towards how they have become
        outdated

        Most visions of utopia imagine humanity with untold power. We envision shining megacities, planetary
        megastructures, dyson-spheres. Even in more naturalistic visions, we still imagine humanity in complete
        control over our surrounding environment.
        These utopias are great. However, with humanity as it is they would likely rapidly decline into dystopia
        through misuse.
        I believe that the most impactful/hopeful/useful way to interact with the world in this hour is to play a
        part in the building of the human prefrontal cortex. Assembling the tools which will allow us to mediate
        our
        collective emotion.

      <h2>Act 2: The State of the (non) Union</h2>
      <p>
        Problems of divisiveness and lack of cross-functional understanding. Thesis on why this is the case (Lack of
        necessity, lack of practice, lack of transparency etc.). Talk about incentive structures etc. Everyone is
        displeased
