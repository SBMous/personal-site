## TL;DR

Pnyx is a decentralised protocol which allows a community to democratically author a shared document without requiring any trusted third parties. It uses a combination of frontier cryptographic technologies such as ZK Proof, Homomorphic Encryption and Multi-Party Computation to enable the Liquid Democratic process whilst avoiding centralised points of vulnerability and maintaining privacy.

## Liquid Democracy

The first thing required for understanding the Pnyx project is an understanding of Liquid Democracy. Liquid Democracy is effectively a hybrid of Direct and Representative democratic systems which enables the voter empowerment promised by the Direct system whilst mitigating the risks posed by low voter engagement.

Liquid Democracy is formally characterised by four features:

1. 'Direct Democracy' - The ability for members of a community to vote directly on issues
2. 'Flexible Delegation' - The ability for members to delegate their vote to be cast by another in lieu of their own direct decision
3. 'Meta-delegation' - The ability for delegated votes to be 're-delegated' by the selected delegate, forming a chain of delegations
4. 'Instant Recall' - The ability for members to recall or alter their delegation at any point in time, as well as to override the verdict of their delegate with their own

## Self-Ratification

One of the most important proposals of the Pnyx protocol is that it is 'self-ratifying'. This means that there is no middleman who can veto the passage of a proposal which has been approved by the general population. In real-world examples of liquid democracy this has been the most frequent reason for the experiments' failure.

## Proof-of-Personhood

Proof of personhood is a very important concept for the Pnyx system. It serves two main roles:

1. Ensures that we have a set of veriviable public keys which we can use to prevent double vote casting
2. Serves as the underlying

## Technological Basis

Pnyx relies on a wide variety of underlying technologies:

- Blockchain - For decentralised storage
  - Proof of Authority
