What would I like to achieve?

My answer to this is unfortunately expansive and nebulous. Overall, I wish to advance the human frontier and improve the human condition. I want to build things which mean that humans, at scale, can flourish more easily.

TODO: Examine the idea of 'flourishing'

There are a number of ways in which I wish to do this:

- Advancing education paradigms to increase the volume of free-thinking, ideologically resilient individuals
- Developing an ideologically flexible ideological framework (A framework which fills the void of a necessary ideology, but is simultaneously flexible enough to be self updating on a reasonable timeline)

A lot of these have become mentally hinged on the idea of splinter societies, societal microcosms in which genuinely radical experimentation with the social fabric can take place. This problem is one which I should give a lot more thought to. Potentially, in building a sense of a framework for this and formulating the argument for some of the experiments I think would be useful, there is a space to find an audience for these things to happen.

## A better future

I believe a better future is underpinned by a few things:

- Collaboration as preferential to competition
- Abundance through technology and automation
- Social cohesion through better mechanisms for interpersonal understanding and promotion of inquisitiveness

### Collaboration

I think it is about time for a major paradigm shift. Throughout our evolution, we have adapted into a competitive world. A world where whether you eat or not may impact whether I myself have to go hungry.

This assumption is no longer relevant.

We, as a species, are supremely capable of placing ourselves in a post-scarcity world. I would suggest that this may be possible within a matter of months if we secured the collaboration of the entire human race (And thereby the sum of all of our knowledge and industry). From there, our ability to provide for all would only accelerate.

Unfortunately, the hardware of humans is not adapted to this reality, and instead appears to be somewhat hard coded to believe in scarcity as a baseline. Thus, to arrive in a collaborative first world we require a meta-structure which encourages collaboration as a competitive advantage (Ie. he who collaborates best will succeed the most).

### True Abundance

True abundance is very close. I think the major next step is bringing energy to a level of availability where it may as well be free. If we can achieve this, then many other concerns become far more trivial as we have the ability to literally just throw more energy at it. Want more water? Purify seawater. Want more minerals? Send mining probes into space. Want more food? Build vertical farms with artificial lights.

Without the myriad pressures of meeting basic needs, individuals are given significantly more space to explore and to learn. Done correctly, it seems obvious that this would allow huge strides in collective intelligence.

The absence of basic need does potentially create risk. It is a commonly touted adage that good times create weak people, and that weak people inherently atrophy society into bad times. It would be imperative that something constructive is placed in front of society at all times which requires the collective flexing of intellectual and industrial muscle such that society does not lose its way and atrophy in hedonism.

### A Hope for Humanity

Generally speaking, I overwhelmingly believe in the goodness of humans. I strongly feel that almost all civilizational problems come down to the fact that humanity has not yet had enough time to 'grow up' and discover the secrets to success at a wide scale. Humanity sits currently in an awkward teenage phase, where it is capable enough to enact huge change on the world, but lacks the maturity to know what, when and how this change should be applied. Unfortunately, we also lack a 'parent' to guide us through the dark, and seem to put ourselves in danger as much as we succeed in our escapades.
